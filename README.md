# Data Alchemist üöÄ

_A smart tool to turn messy spreadsheet data into a clean, validated, and rule-based configuration._

---

This project is a Next.js web application built for the Digitalyz Software Engineering Intern assignment. It's designed to help non-technical users take raw data from multiple sources, clean it up, and configure it for downstream use, all with the help of AI.

## Key Features

This application is packed with features to make data handling simple and intuitive:

- **üìÑ Full Data Ingestion:** Upload `CSV` or `XLSX` files for clients, workers, and tasks.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Interactive Grid:** View all your data in a high-performance grid. You can edit any cell directly, just like in a spreadsheet.
- **‚úÖ Real-time Validation:** The app automatically runs 8+ validation rules (like checking for duplicate IDs, out-of-range values, and broken references) the moment you upload or edit data. Errors are highlighted right in the grid and listed in a summary panel.
- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Search:** No need for complex filters. Just type what you're looking for in plain English (e.g., _"clients with priority greater than 3"_) to instantly filter the data.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Flexible Rule Engine:**
  - **Manual Builder:** A step-by-step UI to create custom business rules (like co-run, slot-restriction, and load-limit rules).
  - **AI Converter:** Describe a rule in a simple sentence (e.g., _"workers in DevTeamA can only work on 2 tasks per phase"_) and let the AI instantly generate the correct JSON rule.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Prioritization & Weights:** Use simple sliders to set the priority for different business criteria, like maximizing fulfillment or ensuring fairness.
- **üì§ Full Export:** Download your cleaned-up data as separate `.csv` files and a complete `rules.json` file containing all your created rules and weights with a single click.
- **üé® Modern UI:** A clean, responsive interface built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, complete with a dark/light mode toggle.
